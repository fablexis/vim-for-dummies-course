**Moving the cursor**

| `[count]K` | `[count]` times up           |
| `[count]L` | `[count]` times to the right |

**Moving through the file**

| Key | Moves to                                    |
|-----|---------------------------------------------|
| `0` | First character of the line                 |
| `$` | End of the current line                     |
| `gg`| First line on the first non-blank character |
| `G` | Last line on the first non-blank character  |

**Moving in a line**

| Key        | Decription                                           |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `[count]w` | `count` words forward (punctuation considered words) |
| `[count]W` | `count` words forward (spaces separate words)        |
| `[count]e` | `count` words forward (punctuation considered words) |
| `[count]E` | `count` words forward (no punctuation)               |
| `[count]b` | `count` words backward  (*)                          |
| `[count]B` | `count` WORDS backward  (*)                          |

(*) Note: 
> Like most of the capitalized movement pairs, b moves by **word**, but B moves by **WORD**. The difference is that vim considers a "word" to be letters, numbers, and underscores (and you can configure this with the iskeyword setting), but a "WORD" is always anything that isn't whitespace.
